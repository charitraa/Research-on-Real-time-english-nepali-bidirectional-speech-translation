Machine Translation (MT) has evolved significantly with advancements in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Transformer-based models, improving the translation of low-resource languages like Nepali. The reviewed studies explore different approaches to English-Nepali translation, comparing Statistical Machine Translation (SMT), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformer-based models to identify the most effective techniques.

Moslem et al. (2023) highlight the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and BLOOM in translation tasks. While LLMs excel in high-resource languages, their performance declines for low-resource languages like Nepali due to limited training data. To address this, the study introduces adaptive machine translation techniques, including fuzzy matching, which retrieves previous translations to improve consistency and accuracy.

Acharya & Bal (2018) present a comparative analysis of SMT and NMT for English-Nepali translation. Their findings indicate that SMT performs better with smaller datasets, whereas NMT outperforms SMT when trained on larger datasets. Additionally, the study highlights key challenges, including word order differences (SVO in English vs. SOV in Nepali) and the morphological complexity of Nepali, which hinder accurate translation and emphasize the need for robust datasets and deep learning enhancements.

Nemkul & Shakya (2021) propose an NMT model incorporating RNNs with Attention mechanisms for English-Nepali translation. The study compares different architectures, including LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM, and finds that GRU + Attention achieves the best performance with a BLEU score of 12.3. The research highlights the role of attention mechanisms in improving translation accuracy by allowing the model to focus on essential words within a sentence, thereby enhancing contextual understanding.

Recent advancements in speech-to-speech translation and sequence modeling have significantly improved real-time language processing. The first study introduces a real-time incremental speech-to-speech (S2S) translation system using a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)-based framework. Unlike traditional S2S models that require complete sentence processing, this system generates partial translations incrementally, reducing latency while maintaining translation quality. Experimental results highlight the trade-off between accuracy and response time, demonstrating that incremental translation provides faster, efficient cross-lingual communication.

an open-source PyTorch-based toolkit for sequence modeling tasks like machine translation, summarization, and language modeling. Designed for efficiency, it supports distributed training across multiple GPUs, mixed-precision computation, and optimized inference techniques such as beam search. The study benchmarks FAIRSEQ against other frameworks, showing improved BLEU scores and enhanced performance for large-scale datasets, making it a crucial tool for research and production in natural language processing (NLP).

Nepali speech recognition, a relatively underexplored domain, by analyzing various speech processing approaches such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Neural Networks, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). It introduces an alternative "Ear Model" that simulates human auditory perception, leveraging phoneme classification and syllable frequency analysis to enhance recognition accuracy. The study emphasizes the importance of language-specific adaptations and proposes techniques like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for feature extraction, making the model highly relevant for speech-based applications in Nepali.

AI-Powered Real-Time Speech-to-Speech Translation for Virtual Meetings Using Machine Learning Modelsâ€‹
, examines prior studies on speech-to-speech translation and their application in virtual meetings. It discusses the role of word embeddings in optimizing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and speech translation (ST) models, leveraging transformer-based architectures like BERT and GPT to improve accuracy. The paper also highlights challenges in end-to-end speech translation for syntactically different languages and explores attention-based encoder-decoder models to address them. Additionally, it reviews Unsupervised Neural Machine Translation (UNMT) techniques and proposes improvements in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) through phrase alignment for better interpretability. Another key discussion revolves around training multilingual and multi-speaker text-to-speech (TTS) systems based on language families, which can enhance speech synthesis for real-time translations.
